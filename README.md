# Meeting Analyzer

Meeting Analyzer is an Open-Source web application designed to record, transcribe, and analyze business conversations, helping teams extract key insights, improve collaboration, and make data-driven decisions.

## The Problem

Valuable information shared during meetings (sales calls, customer interviews, internal discussions) is often lost or hard to recall. Manually reviewing recordings is time-consuming, and extracting meaningful patterns or action items is challenging.

## Our Solution

Meeting Analyzer provides a central hub to:

*   **Visualize Recordings:** Easily playback call recordings with speaker identification.
*   **Searchable Transcripts:** Quickly find specific moments or keywords within the conversation.
*   **Speaker Analysis:** Understand participation dynamics and speaking time.
*   **AI-Powered Insights (Future):** Automatically generate summaries, identify action items, track topics, and analyze sentiment.

## Target Audience

Teams and individuals across various departments (Sales, Customer Success, Product, Management) who rely on meetings and want to maximize their value.

## Key Value

*   **Save Time:** Reduce manual review with searchable transcripts and summaries.
*   **Unlock Insights:** Identify trends, customer feedback, and coaching opportunities.
*   **Improve Collaboration:** Easily share key moments and findings with colleagues.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Base strategies and actions on actual conversation data.

## External Services Setup

This project relies on several external services. Ensure you have configured the following:

1.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the necessary API keys:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://APIURL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=ANONKEY
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=SERVICEROLEKEY
    GROQ_API_KEY=GROQAPIKEY
    ```

2.  **Modal Labs (Optional - for specific processing tasks):** If you need to run or develop functions using [Modal Labs](https://modal.com/), you need to authenticate the Modal CLI locally. Run the following command in your terminal and paste your token ID and secret when prompted:
    ```bash
    modal token set --token-id ak-ma0lG7ouzQSpDfB1yylsQr --token-secret as-d8eEYRg1R1B3RJXK7HjPng
    ```

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd meeting-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Set up Node.js:** Ensure you are using the LTS version (e.g., using nvm):
    ```bash
    nvm use --lts
    ```

3.  **Prepare Supabase Project:**
    - Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
    - Get your Project URL from `Project Settings` > `API` > `Project URL`
    - Get your Anon Key and Service Key from `Project Settings` > `API` > `anon public` and `service_role`

4.  **Setup Supabase locally:**
    ```bash
    # Login to supabase
    npx supabase login
    
    # Link project to supabase (requires database password)
    npx supabase link
    
    # Push configuration to the server
    npx supabase config push
    
    # Run migrations
    npx supabase migrations up --linked
    ```

5.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn
    ```

6.  **Copy environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    And update with your Supabase and Groq credentials.

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

8.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
