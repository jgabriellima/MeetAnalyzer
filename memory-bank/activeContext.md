# Active Context: Meeting Analyzer

## Current Work Focus
1. **Core Application Structure:** Setting up the main Next.js App Router structure, including layout, navigation, and basic pages for meetings.
2. **Enhanced Transcription System:** Implementing a comprehensive data model to support advanced transcription features:
   - Word-level transcription with timestamps
   - Chapter detection and summarization
   - Entity recognition
   - Topic categorization
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Auto-highlights
   - Speaker diarization with detailed metrics
3. **Processing Architecture:** Implementing the hybrid processing approach with Edge Functions and ModalLabs Serverless
4. **Data Storage Optimization:** Designing efficient storage and retrieval patterns for rich transcription data

## Recent Changes
- **Enhanced Database Schema:** Significantly expanded the transcription data model to include:
  - Word-level transcription storage
  - Chapter information with summaries
  - Entity detection results
  - Topic categorization
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Auto-generated highlights
  - Detailed speaker metrics
  - Utterance-level organization
- **Data Access Patterns:** Implemented new patterns for efficient data access:
  - Hierarchical data fetching
  - Feature-based access control
  - Progressive data loading
  - Optimized query patterns
- **Storage Strategy:** Defined comprehensive storage approach:
  - Immediate storage for core data
  - Progressive enhancement for advanced features
  - Optimization techniques for large datasets
  - Data integrity constraints

## Active Decisions
- Using a comprehensive data model to support all transcription features
- Implementing progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Storing detailed word-level information for precise playback
- Maintaining speaker statistics for analytics
- Using materialized views for common analytics queries
- Implementing efficient data access patterns
- Following strict data integrity rules

## Current Considerations
- Need to implement efficient indexing strategies for large transcripts
- Consider partitioning strategies for scaling
- Plan for data archival and cleanup
- Monitor storage usage and query performance
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Plan for analytics and reporting features
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery
- Consider data migration strategy for existing transcripts

## Next Steps
1. **Database Migration:**
   - Create new tables for enhanced features
   - Set up proper indexes
   - Implement partitioning strategy
   - Create materialized views

2. **Provider Updates:**
   - Update AssemblyAI provider to store all available data
   - Implement feature detection and progressive storage
   - Add support for partial data updates
   - Enhance error handling

3. **Frontend Enhancement:**
   - Update UI to show new features
   - Implement progressive loading
   - Add feature toggles
   - Enhance analytics display

4. **Testing & Validation:**
   - Test with large transcripts
   - Validate performance
   - Check data integrity
   - Verify feature detection

## Open Questions
- How should transcription be triggered? (e.g., automatically after upload, manually via button?)
- Where will the actual transcript text be stored? (In the `meetings` table, separate table, or file storage?)
- What NLP service/logic will be used to generate the topics/themes for the overview graph?
- How should errors during asynchronous operations within tab components be handled and displayed to the user?
- How to best handle synchronization between the media player, transcript, and speaker timeline in real-time?
- What approach should be used to generate the timeline visualization from actual transcript data?

## Current Focus: Modal Labs Integration

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Modal functions deployed independently
   - Each function exposed as HTTP endpoint
   - URLs managed via environment variables

2. **Integration Pattern**
   - Edge Functions as API gateway
   - Provider pattern for Modal interaction
   - HTTP-only communication in production

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Develop Modal functions locally
   - Deploy to staging/production
   - Store endpoint URLs in environment

### Implementation Status
1. **Completed**
   - Basic Modal function structure
   - FastAPI endpoint configuration
   - Provider pattern definition

2. **In Progress**
   - Deployment automation
   - Environment management
   - Integration testing

3. **Next Steps**
   - Implement health checks
   - Set up monitoring
   - Configure auto-scaling
   - Document deployment process

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance**
   - Cold start management
   - Resource optimization
   - Scaling configuration

2. **Security**
   - Token management
   - Secret rotation
   - Access control

3. **Monitoring**
   - Health check implementation
   - Metric collection
   - Alert configuration

### Action Items
1. [ ] Create deployment scripts
2. [ ] Set up environment variables
3. [ ] Implement health checks
4. [ ] Configure monitoring
5. [ ] Document integration process
6. [ ] Test scaling behavior
7. [ ] Review security measures
