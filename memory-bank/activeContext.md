# Active Context: Meeting Analyzer

## Current Work Focus
1. Implementing pluggable provider architecture:
   - Creating abstract provider interfaces for transcription services
   - Developing specific adapters for AssemblyAI, Whisper, and Google Speech-to-Text
   - Building provider configuration and selection system
   - Setting up fallback mechanisms for resilience

2. Enhancing the meeting interface with dynamic relationship mapping:
   - Replacing static flowcharts with weighted topic relationships
   - Implementing NLP-based analysis for topic importance
   - Creating interactive visualization with D3.js force-directed graphs
   - Enabling cross-meeting theme exploration

3. Developing integration frameworks:
   - CRM connectors (Salesforce, Hubspot) for business context
   - Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook) for meeting management
   - Meeting platform connectors for automatic recording ingestion
   - Adapter interfaces for extensibility

4. Restructuring navigation from meeting-centric to theme-centric:
   - Implementing theme-based organization across meetings
   - Creating pre-meeting context preparation features
   - Building cross-meeting theme timelines
   - Developing insight-first navigation

## Recent Changes
- Updated architecture to use provider/adapter pattern for external services
- Replaced static flowcharts with dynamic relationship mapping
- Added integrations for CRMs and calendar systems
- Restructured navigation from meeting-centric to theme-centric
- Added pre-meeting preparation functionality
- Enhanced transcription with emotional analysis

## Active Decisions
- Using provider/adapter pattern for flexible service integration
- Implementing D3.js force-directed graphs for relationship visualization
- Supporting multiple transcription providers through common interface
- Reorganizing navigation from meeting-first to theme-first
- Prioritizing automatic meeting ingestion over manual uploads
- Integrating with business systems for contextual intelligence
- Adding emotional analysis for communication coaching

## Current Considerations
- Provider interface design for maximum flexibility while maintaining consistency
- Relationship visualization algorithm for meaningful topic connections
- Integration authentication and security for third-party services
- Efficient data structures for theme-based organization
- Pre-meeting briefing generation strategy
- Cross-language topic matching for multilingual support
- Extensibility model for future integration points
