# Progress: Meeting Analyzer

## Current Status
The Meeting Analyzer project is undergoing significant technical architecture updates to enhance flexibility and feature set. The core architecture is being redesigned to use provider/adapter patterns for external services, dynamic relationship mapping for visualization, and deeper business system integrations.

## What Works
- Project repository initialized
- Basic documentation established
- Tech stack identified
- Development environment configuration defined
- Provider/adapter architecture designed
- Dynamic relationship mapping approach defined

## What's Left to Build
Prioritized by development order:

### Phase 1: Provider Architecture
- [ ] Abstract provider interfaces
- [ ] Provider configuration system
- [ ] AssemblyAI adapter implementation
- [ ] Whisper adapter implementation
- [ ] Google Speech-to-Text adapter implementation
- [ ] Feature detection mechanism
- [ ] Provider fallback handling

### Phase 2: Dynamic Relationship Mapping
- [ ] Topic extraction and analysis system
- [ ] Relationship weighting algorithm
- [ ] D3.js force-directed graph implementation
- [ ] Interactive visualization controls
- [ ] Cross-meeting theme discovery
- [ ] Theme timeline visualization

### Phase 3: Business System Integration
- [ ] Integration adapter interfaces
- [ ] CRM connectors (Salesforce, Hubspot)
- [ ] Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook)
- [ ] Meeting platform connectors
- [ ] Automatic ingestion pipelines
- [ ] OAuth authentication flows
- [ ] Secure token management

### Phase 4: Theme-Centric Organization
- [ ] Theme-based navigation
- [ ] Cross-meeting theme tracking
- [ ] Pre-meeting briefing generation
- [ ] Theme evolution timeline
- [ ] Insight-based filtering and discovery
- [ ] Theme-based search enhancements
- [ ] Multilingual theme matching

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Emotional analysis and visualization
- [ ] Team performance dashboards
- [ ] Communication coaching system
- [ ] Insight recommendation engine
- [ ] Business opportunity detection
- [ ] Multi-lingual support
- [ ] Data export and integration APIs

## Known Issues
As the project is undergoing architectural redesign, there are no specific code issues yet, but potential challenges include:

## Potential Challenges
- Creating consistent interfaces across diverse provider capabilities
- Balancing abstract adapters with provider-specific feature extensions
- Ensuring seamless fallback between providers
- Managing OAuth token security and renewal for multiple integrations
- Optimizing NLP processing for relationship mapping
- Implementing effective cross-language theme matching
- Synchronizing theme-based organization with meeting-specific context
- Handling provider rate limits and cost optimization

## Recent Achievements
- Redesigned system architecture to use provider/adapter pattern
- Developed approach for dynamic relationship mapping
- Created framework for theme-based organization
- Designed integration points for business systems
- Established pre-meeting preparation feature set
- Enhanced multilingual capabilities

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Define abstract provider interfaces
2. Implement configuration system for provider selection
3. Create base adapter implementations
4. Develop provider feature detection mechanism
5. Build provider fallback system
6. Implement topic extraction and analysis components
7. Create relationship weighting algorithm
