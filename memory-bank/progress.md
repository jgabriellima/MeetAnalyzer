# Current Progress: Meeting Analyzer

## Current Status
The Meeting Analyzer project is in active development with the core application structure established and key features in progress. The current focus areas include:
- Implementing the hybrid processing architecture with Edge Functions and ModalLabs Serverless
- Developing the meeting details page with improved layout and speaker timeline visualization
- Implementing meeting creation flow with file upload
- Setting up Supabase integration for authentication, database, and storage
- Creating API routes for meeting data fetching
- Addressing type definitions and database schema consistency

## Recently Completed
- Refined database schema for transcription system
  - Improved field naming and nullability constraints
  - Streamlined speaker and metadata storage
  - Enhanced type safety with string literal types
- Removed legacy MeetingState enum in favor of string-based status
- Updated type definitions for better TypeScript integration
- Enhanced meetings table with comprehensive transcription fields
- Created comprehensive sequence diagrams for:
  - Audio upload and transcription flow
  - Error handling flow
  - Status management flow
  - Data storage flow
- Documented implementation patterns and strategies

## What Works
- **Authentication Flow** - Basic sign-up and login functionality using Supabase Authentication.
- **Database Schema** - Initial tables defined in Supabase migrations and working on local development.
- **Unified Supabase Client** - The `SassClient` class now handles authentication, database access, and storage operations.
- **File Upload** - Meeting recording files can be uploaded to Supabase storage.
- **Meeting Creation** - Users can create new meetings by providing title, description, and uploading a recording file.
- **Meeting List** - Basic list of meetings with filtering options.
- **Meeting Details Page** - Two-column layout with:
  - Left column: Video/audio player and speaker timeline visualization
  - Right column: Tabs for Overview, Transcript, Comments, and ChatGPT
- **Speaker Timeline** - Visual representation of when each participant spoke during the meeting with:
  - Color-coded blocks for each speaker
  - Speaking time percentages
  - Time markers
  - Current playback position indicator
- Database schema for transcription system
- Type definitions for all transcription-related tables
- Status management system for transcription workflow
- Foreign key relationships and data integrity constraints
- Basic transcription provider setup
- Event-based status updates
- Webhook handling for AssemblyAI
- File upload and storage integration

## In Progress
- AssemblyAI provider implementation
- Webhook handling for transcription updates
- Frontend components for transcription status display
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## What's Left to Build
- **Processing Architecture** - Implement the hybrid approach:
  - Edge Functions structure and providers
  - ModalLabs Serverless configuration and providers
  - Provider/adapter pattern implementation
  - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Meeting Overview Component** - D3.js force-directed graph for topic visualization needs to be connected to actual data.
- **Meeting Transcript Component** - Needs to fetch and display the actual transcript data with speaker information.
- **Meeting Comments Component** - Requires implementation of comment fetching and creation functionality.
- **Meeting ChatGPT Component** - Needs complete implementation for AI interaction.
- **API Integration** - Replace mock data in API routes with actual processing logic.
- **Recording Processing** - Implement transcription service integration for automated processing of uploaded recordings.
- **Topic Extraction** - Implement NLP-based topic extraction from transcript text.
- **Real-time Visualization** - Connect speaker timeline with actual transcript data and synchronize with media playback.
- **User Settings** - Account settings and preferences management.
- **Relationship Mapping** - For showing connections between meeting themes over time.

## Known Issues
- **Linter Errors** - Persistent linter errors related to module resolution for components in `src/app/app/meetings/[id]/page.tsx`. These appear to be false positives, likely resolvable by restarting the dev server.
- **Type Consistency** - Occasional mismatch between TypeScript types and the actual database schema, requiring manual synchronization.
- **Playback Synchronization** - No current mechanism to synchronize the speaker timeline and transcript with the media player.
- **Mock Data Dependencies** - Currently using mock data for API routes and timeline visualization. Need to be replaced with actual data.
- **Need to validate transcription configuration JSON**
- **Consider performance implications of JSON metadata storage**
- **Plan for handling additional transcription statuses**
- **Ensure consistent error handling across all endpoints**

## Potential Challenges
- **Database Schema Evolution** - As the application grows, managing schema changes with Supabase migrations may become complex.
- **Performance with Large Transcripts** - Large meeting transcripts may cause performance issues in the UI, especially with the speaker timeline visualization.
- **Authentication State Management** - Ensuring consistent user authentication state across the application.
- **Media Processing** - Efficiently handling large audio/video files and their processing.
- **NLP Quality** - Ensuring high-quality topic extraction and relationship mapping from transcript text.

## Recent Achievements
- Successfully implemented the unified Supabase client (`SassClient`) with methods for user management, file operations, and database access.
- Created a functional meeting creation page with file upload capability.
- Redesigned the meeting details page with a two-column layout and speaker timeline visualization.
- Resolved critical bugs related to database schema updates and Supabase client integration.
- Updated database migrations to align TypeScript types with the actual database schema.

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. **Fix Linter Errors** - Resolve the persistent linter errors in `src/app/app/meetings/[id]/page.tsx`, possibly by restarting the development server or updating import paths.
2. **Implement Real Data Fetching** - Replace mock data in the `MeetingOverview`, `MeetingTranscript`, and `MeetingComments` components with actual data fetching from API or database.
3. **Define Transcription Trigger** - Implement the mechanism to trigger transcription processing after a recording is uploaded.
4. **Connect Speaker Timeline** - Link the speaker timeline visualization with actual transcript data and synchronize with media playback.
5. **Update API Routes** - Replace mock data in API routes with actual data processing logic.
