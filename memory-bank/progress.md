# Progress: Meeting Analyzer

## Current Status
- Core application structure (Next.js App Router) is in place.
- Supabase integration is functional: schema defined, migrations applied, RLS policies set up, client class implemented.
- Basic UI for listing, creating, and viewing meetings is implemented.
- API routes for fetching meeting details and topics (mock data) are created.
- Several critical bugs related to dependencies, async params, and database queries have been resolved.

## What Works
- Project setup and core dependencies.
- Supabase authentication, database (with current schema), and storage.
- Database migrations workflow.
- Row Level Security policies for `meetings`, `accounts`, `meeting_participants`, `meeting_themes`, `meeting_comments`.
- Unified `SassClient` for Supabase interactions.
- Meeting creation page (`/app/meetings/new`) with file upload.
- Basic Meeting details page (`/app/meetings/[id]`) rendering structure and fetching meeting data.
- API route `/api/meetings/[id]/topics` responding (with mock data).
- Navigation between meeting list, new meeting, and meeting details.

## What's Left to Build
Prioritized by development order:

### Phase 1: Core Meeting Details Functionality
- [ ] Fix persistent linter errors in `MeetingDetailPage` (likely cache-related).
- [ ] Implement actual data fetching within `MeetingOverview` (replace mock topics API/data).
- [ ] Implement actual data fetching/display within `MeetingTranscript`.
- [ ] Implement actual data fetching/display/creation within `MeetingComments`.
- [ ] Implement basic functionality for `MeetingChatGPT`.
- [ ] Connect transcript search input.

### Phase 2: Transcription & Analysis Integration (dependent on `Provider Architecture`)
- [ ] Define transcription trigger mechanism (auto/manual).
- [ ] Decide transcript storage location.
- [ ] Implement chosen NLP service/logic for topic/theme generation.
- [ ] Integrate transcription results into `MeetingTranscript`.
- [ ] Integrate topic/theme results into `MeetingOverview` & database (`meeting_themes`).

### Phase 3: Provider Architecture
- [ ] Abstract provider interfaces (Transcription, NLP, etc.)
- [ ] Provider configuration system
- [ ] AssemblyAI adapter implementation
- [ ] Whisper adapter implementation
- [ ] Google Speech-to-Text adapter implementation
- [ ] Feature detection mechanism
- [ ] Provider fallback handling

### Phase 4: Business System Integration
- [ ] Integration adapter interfaces
- [ ] CRM connectors (Salesforce, Hubspot)
- [ ] Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook)
- [ ] Meeting platform connectors
- [ ] Automatic ingestion pipelines
- [ ] OAuth authentication flows
- [ ] Secure token management

### Phase 5: Theme-Centric Organization
- [ ] Theme-based navigation
- [ ] Cross-meeting theme tracking
- [ ] Pre-meeting briefing generation
- [ ] Theme evolution timeline
- [ ] Insight-based filtering and discovery
- [ ] Theme-based search enhancements
- [ ] Multilingual theme matching

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] Emotional analysis and visualization
- [ ] Team performance dashboards
- [ ] Communication coaching system
- [ ] Insight recommendation engine
- [ ] Business opportunity detection
- [ ] Multi-lingual support refinement
- [ ] Data export and integration APIs

## Known Issues
- Persistent (likely cache-related) linter errors for module resolution (`Cannot find module './...'`) in `src/app/app/meetings/[id]/page.tsx` despite files existing.
- API route `/api/meetings/[id]/topics` currently returns mock data.
- Tab components (`MeetingOverview`, `MeetingTranscript`, etc.) within the details page are not yet fetching/displaying real data.

## Potential Challenges
- Creating consistent interfaces across diverse provider capabilities
- Balancing abstract adapters with provider-specific feature extensions
- Ensuring seamless fallback between providers
- Managing OAuth token security and renewal for multiple integrations
- Optimizing NLP processing for relationship mapping
- Implementing effective cross-language theme matching
- Synchronizing theme-based organization with meeting-specific context
- Handling provider rate limits and cost optimization
- Debugging persistent linter/cache issues.

## Recent Achievements
- **Database Schema & Migrations:** Successfully defined and migrated schema for core meeting features, including `accounts` and relationships.
- **Supabase Client:** Implemented and refined the unified `SassClient`.
- **Meeting CRUD Basics:** Enabled creation of meetings with file uploads and viewing of basic meeting details.
- **API Structure:** Set up initial API routes for meeting data.
- **Bug Fixes:** Resolved critical build, runtime, and Supabase query errors related to dependencies and async parameter handling.
- **Type Safety:** Improved type safety by using `supabase gen types` and correcting type errors.

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Attempt to resolve persistent linter errors (restart dev server/editor).
2. Implement real data fetching and display logic for `MeetingOverview` (using topics API or direct fetch).
3. Implement real data fetching and display logic for `MeetingTranscript`.
4. Implement real data fetching and commenting functionality for `MeetingComments`.
5. Define transcription trigger mechanism and storage strategy.
