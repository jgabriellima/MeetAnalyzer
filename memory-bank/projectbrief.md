# Project Brief: Meeting Analyzer

## Project Overview
Meeting Analyzer is an Open-Source web application designed to record, transcribe, and analyze business conversations, helping teams extract key insights, improve collaboration, and make data-driven decisions by integrating meeting data with business workflows.

## Core Problem
Valuable information shared during meetings (sales calls, customer interviews, internal discussions) is often lost, hard to recall, or disconnected from business systems. Manually reviewing recordings is time-consuming, and extracting meaningful patterns or action items across multiple meetings is challenging.

## Solution
A comprehensive meeting intelligence platform with:
- Automatic meeting ingestion from popular platforms
- Provider-based transcription system with multiple service options
- Dynamic topic relationship mapping with NLP-based weighting
- Theme-based organization across meeting collections
- Pre-meeting contextual preparation
- CRM and calendar integration for business context
- Emotional analysis and communication coaching
- AI assistant for meeting intelligence

## Interface Structure
The meeting analyzer interface is organized into four key tabs:
1. **Overview Tab:** Provides dynamic topic relationship maps with weighted connections; enables theme exploration across meetings; visualizes connections to CRM opportunities
2. **Transcript Tab:** Displays the diarized transcription with speaker separation and emotional indicators; allows clicking on sections to navigate to specific timestamps
3. **Comments Tab:** Shows comments organized by transcript sections with threading and business context
4. **Assistant Tab:** Provides a chat interface for meeting intelligence, theme exploration, and communication coaching

## Organization Philosophy
- **Theme-First, Not Meeting-First:** Organize by evolving themes rather than chronological meetings
- **Pre-Meeting Context:** Provide historical context before meetings instead of only post-meeting analysis
- **Connected Intelligence:** Link meeting insights to business systems (CRM, calendar) for actionable outcomes
- **Pluggable Architecture:** Support multiple providers for transcription, NLP, and business integrations

## Target Audience
